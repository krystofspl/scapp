  Scenario: As a coach who created the realization, I want to remove a set from it

    And I click "Edit sets" tab
    When I click "Delete" for exercise set realization with index "2"
    And I confirm popup
    Then I shouldn't see an exercise set for the realization with text "10 minutes"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Exercise with sets has to have at least one set
    Given I have "coach" role
    And I am at the "/scheduled_lessons/training-5-5-2050-13-00-14-00/exercise_realizations" page
    When I click Edit for exercise realization "excprivate" in plan for user "test2"
