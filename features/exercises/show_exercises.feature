Feature: View exercises
  In order to view available exercises
  As admin I can view any exercise
  As coach I can view my private exercises and global exercises
  # !!! nemusi se nutne jednat o globalni cvik vlastneny adminem - staci pouze priznak global
  # !!! je to z duvodu, ze admin nemusi v systemu zustat natrvalo jako administrator, muze spadnout napr. na couche
  #(As player I can view exercise details only as a part of an exercise realization, I can't view exercise list)
