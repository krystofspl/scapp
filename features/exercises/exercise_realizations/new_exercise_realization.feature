  Scenario: As coach I can add a new realization
    Given I have "coach" role
    And I am at the "/scheduled_lessons/training2-5-5-2050-13-00-14-00/exercise_realizations" page
    When I drag and drop exercise "excprivate" to plan for user "test2"
    # Need to visit the page again because of caching, elements are refreshed with AJAX
    And I visit page "/scheduled_lessons/training2-5-5-2050-13-00-14-00/exercise_realizations"
    Then I should see realization "excprivate" in the plan for user "test2"
